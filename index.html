    <h1>Vacation Trip: Panama City Beach, Florida</h1>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Where did you go</h2>
    <p>
      I visited <strong>Panama City Beach, Florida</strong>, famous for its
      Gulf waters and the beautiful beaches. With 27 miles of coastline, itâ€™s
      perfect for a relaxing beach trip that still has plenty to do within a
      short walk or drive.

    <h2>What did a day consist of</h2>
    <p>
      My day consisted of waking up, walking to grab breakfast from the Pancakery and going out to the Pier to shop. After walking around Pier Park I would then visit the beach and watch the sunset.
